# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-via-dlib-and-YOLO
I have created a real time face recognition system which can scan faces and detected faces will be stored in the respective made folder and from there the faces which were already given will be compared and the compared face will be ticked for attendance. 
I had developed this system using YOLOv8 for detection of faces and I have used the dlib for face recogntion and comparison further. 

You have to download the packages and yolo versions correctly including the dlib file.

You can mail me for further queries niveditakothuri0506@gmail.com
